# Explanation of the game types
People are different and enjoy different types of games more or less. Below are the 8 game types and their descriptions. These descriptions should help you to better categorize yourself and understand what is particularly important to you in a game. This will hopefully allow you to optimize your own enjoyment by communicating more clearly which aspects are particularly important to you.

## Challenge - The joy of strategy and earned victories
You enjoy being challenged. You like to put in the time to overcome an obstacle. Be it through an optimized character or a sophisticated strategy. The more difficult the path and the closer the result, the more victory means to you. Even setbacks on the way to your goal don't stop you. You are always ready to get up and try again.

If the battles are too easy or too rare, you may already be planning for the next important problem that needs to be solved. Gifted victories are not victories for you. You want to earn them.

## Discovery - The joy of exploration and discovery
You want to discover. You love immersing yourself in unknown worlds and finding new things. It is important to you that you can understand the world around you. You want to know how things work and how they are connected. You are curious and always want to find out more. 

If your group stays in one place for too long, you get nervous. You want to get to know new people and events. 

## Expression - The joy of role-playing and interaction
You love slipping into the role of your character. It is important to you that you find yourself in your character and can portray it authentically. Role-playing is an important part of the game for you. You want to see the world through your character's eyes and interact with other characters.

If the group spends too long discussing rules or getting lost in fights, you become impatient. You also don't enjoy pure dungeon crawl evenings. You want to experience the world and interact with other characters.

## Fantasy - The joy of immersing yourself in another world
You love immersing yourself in another world. It is important to you that the world is fantastic and unusual. You want to experience things that don't exist in the real world. You want to experience magic and wonder and be enchanted by the world. You are also interested in the stories and peculiarities of the world.

A generic world that fades into the background can bother you. Logical breaks and inconsistencies in the world can pull you out of the game. You want to immerse yourself in a world that captivates and inspires you.

## Fellowship - the joy of playing together and group dynamics
You love playing in a group. It is important to you that the group harmonizes and works well together. You want all players to have the opportunity to contribute and be heard. You are willing to put yourself at the service of the group and work together towards a common goal.

Disputes and conflicts in the group can disturb you. You want everyone to be treated fairly and the group to stick together. You are willing to compromise and work for the good of the group.

## Narrative structure - The joy of a completed story with a story arc
You love to experience a story. It is important to you that the story has a clear beginning, an exciting middle section and a satisfying end. You want the story to captivate you and draw you in. You are ready to get involved in the story and be surprised by it.

You want the story to have a clear conclusion or at least have structured acts. Continuing the story forever without a clear conclusion can annoy you. You want the story to have a common thread and work towards a goal.


## Sensation - The joy of sensory impressions
You love shaking a dice cup and the clacking of the dice on the table. The whole thing is accompanied by suitable music and preferably in darkened light. Different voices for the characters in the game also help you to immerse yourself even more in the story. You want to feel the world around you, preferably with all your senses. Scented candles with a tavern scent or similar can sometimes tempt you.

Technology such as a dice app, character sheets on a tablet or PC are not suitable for you. You want **Pen and Paper** and not **App and Screen**.

## Submission - The joy of doing nothing
You like to leave the initiative to others and are happy just to be there. You experience the stories from the inside, but not as a driving force. Sometimes it's also important to let your legs dangle with this hobby and simply enjoy yourself.

A spotlight on your character or an expectation of you is stressful or unpleasant for you. Creativity comes when it is not forced.
